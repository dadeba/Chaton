Chaton (pronounced like [sha-ton]) is a comet-based webchat server.
It is a collection of CGI scripts, daemon programs and other scripts.

Prerequisites:

- Make sure you can run a daemon process on your server.
  It might be difficult if you're using shared hosting
  service.

- It is also desirable that you can make your own crontab.

- The server should also run httpd that is capable to run
  CGI.  The server should be configured so that you can
  do SetHandler in .htaccess file.

- Gauche 0.8.14 or later.  You can install it under
  your home directory.


Programs and directories:

  Chaton uses the following programs:

    chaton-viewer   This is a Comet server responsible to
          distribute room contents.   It must run as a daemon.
          Currently you have to run one daemon process per
          one chatroom.  The actual installed script is named
          'chaton-viewer-ROOMNAME'.

    chaton-poster   This is a CGI script that handles message
          posting.  The actual installed script is named
          'chaton-poster-ROOMNAME'.

    chaton-browser  This is a CGI script that handles browsing
          message archives.  When installed, this script becomes
          'a', for the sake of shorter permalinks.

    chaton-archiver  This is a script file that archives message
          logs.  This script must be run daily.
